    "# Summary",
    "\n## Overview\n",
    "**Ethiopia has been engaged in civil war since the end of 2020, with the conflict leaving thousands dead and driving a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by international energy and food shortages. In November 2022, parties to the conflict signed a peace agreement to cease hostilities. There has been no significant climate policy development under these circumstances.**\n",
    "**In July 2021, Ethiopia submitted an updated NDC,** **but did not increase the ambition of its mitigation target. The CAT rates Ethiopia’s climate targets and action overall as “Almost sufficient,” one of the few countries to earn this rating. The updated NDC is integrated in Ethiopia’s Ten Year Development Plan published in June 2020, and will form the basis of updating its core climate strategy, the 2011 “Climate Resilient Green Economy” (CRGE) strategy; however, no release date has been communicated.**\n",
    "**The CAT’s current Ethiopian emissions projections are higher in 2030 compared to our previous projections, due to revisions in historical data and a smaller than expected impact of the pandemic on emissions. Ethiopia is set to overachieve its unconditional and conditional NDC targets in 2030 under current policies. However, our current projections do not take into consideration the current conflict’s possible impacts on emissions. The IMF has projected a notable drop in the GDP growth rate for 2022, even more drastic than the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.**\n",
    "Ethiopia is one of the few countries that the Climate Action Tracker rates as “Almost Sufficient”. This rating indicates that Ethiopia’s own climate plans are within the range of what is considered to be a fair share of global effort; however, Ethiopia would have to be more ambitious with its internationally supported plans to be consistent with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C temperature limit.\n",
    "The CAT rates Ethiopia’s climate targets and policies as “Almost Sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate commitments are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be with moderate improvements.\n",
    "Ethiopia’s policies and unconditional NDC target meet what would be expected from a least developed country as its fair share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C. However, Ethiopia should also propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional NDC target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming, and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet a more ambitious conditional target.\n",
    "The CAT rates Ethiopia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.\n",
    "Ethiopia will overachieve both the unconditional and conditional NDC targets under current policies, indicating there is room for Ethiopia to increase its target ambition.\n",
    "In its updated NDC, Ethiopia has committed to reduce emissions by 68.8% below a revised BAU (incl. LULUCF) conditional on international support. It will achieve a portion of these reductions unconditionally, using its own resources.\n",
    "The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Ethiopia should propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional NDC target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming, and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet a more ambitious conditional NDC target.\n",
    "Ethiopia intends to achieve this target primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. Yet, Ethiopia cannot ignore the growth in emissions in other sectors. It needs to strengthen its updated conditional NDC target further and will need additional international support to achieve this target.\n",
    "Since the last assessment, the CAT has updated its methodology and pathways included for deriving modelled domestic pathways. As a result of these changes, Ethiopia’s target rating now falls into the ‘Critically insufficient’ category rather than the ‘Highly insufficient’ category. The target itself is unchanged since our last update.\n",
    "The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible”. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.\n",
    "Land use and forestry are a significant source of Ethiopia’s emissions. Ethiopia intends to achieve the conditional and unconditional targets in its updated NDC primarily (around 85%) through reductions in its land sector emissions.\n",
    "Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral without specifying a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from the Global Green Growth Institute, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. We evaluate the target as “Target information incomplete”\n",

    "# Net zero targets",
    "\n## Summary\n",
    "We evaluate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**.\n",
    "Ethiopia intends to become ‘carbon neutral’, but has not specified a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia has not submitted a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy to the UNFCCC as of August 2022, but is in the process of developing one with support from the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI, 2022). This process will include developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. In 2020, Ethiopia joined the Climate Ambition Alliance: Net zero by 2050, but it is unclear what this means for Ethiopia’s net zero ambitions (Climate Ambition Alliance, 2019).\n",

    "\n## Ten key elements\n",
    "**Scope**\n",
    "- **Target year** – Ethiopia does not specify the year it aims to reach carbon neutrality.",
    "- **Emissions coverage** – Ethiopia states its intention to become “carbon neutral” (FDRE, 2015). For this reason, the CAT currently assumes Ethiopia’s target currently only covers CO2 emissions. No detail is available on the sectoral coverage of the target.",
    "- **International aviation and shipping** –Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.",
    "- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target. However, Ethiopia has been a proponent of international carbon markets and has indicated its intention to engage in these markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement in its updated NDC (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).",
    "**Target architecture**\n",
    "- **Legal status** – Ethiopia included its vision to become ‘carbon neutral’ in its INDC of 2015 (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia had not submitted an LTS to the UNFCCC as of August 2022 and did not reference the carbon neutrality target in its 2021 updated NDC (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).",
    "- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.",
    "- **Review process** –Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets",
    "**Transparency**\n",
    "- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.",
    "- **Comprehensive planning** – Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from GGGI, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios (GGGI, 2022).",
    "- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Ethiopia provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.",
    "\n## Good practice\n",
    "The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# 2035 NDC",
    "\n## 2035 NDC Target\n",
    "Ethiopia has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Policies & action",
    "The CAT rates Ethiopia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.\n",
    "Ethiopia will achieve unconditional and conditional NDC targets if current policies are fully implemented, indicating there is room for Ethiopia to increase its target ambition.\n",
    "While Ethiopia rates well when compared to what its fair share contribution is, its policies and action are \"Critically insufficient\" when compared with what modelled domestic pathways based on global least cost pathways say should be occurring within its borders. This rating is based on our upper bound estimate of Ethiopia’s current policies derived from the updated NDC’s business-as-usual scenario for which we do not know which policies it includes. From this perspective, Ethiopia needs to implement more stringent policies and it will need additional support to do so. Such action would be bolstered by adopting a stronger conditional target.\n",
    "\n## Policy overview\n",
    "Since the end of 2020, Ethiopia has been engaged in a civil war between the Tigray People’s Liberation Front and the federal government under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (United Nations Security Council, 2021). On 2 November 2022, the federal government and the TPLF signed a peace deal to end hostilities (UN News, 2022). The conflict has left hundreds of thousands of people dead and has driven a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by international energy and food shortages and restrictions on humanitarian aid. The conflict has led to the most severe starvation crisis in the world, with famine affecting an estimated 900,000 Ethiopians and 1.8 million on the brink (Council on Foreign Relations, 2022). The deal agrees to restore services to the Tigray region and allow unrestricted access for aid agencies (NPR, 2022)\n",
    "Climate policy has advanced little since our last update, unsurprising given the current political climate. Prior to the outbreak of the war, Ethiopia had been making headway, working on updating its 2011 Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy and long-term strategy. The status of the CRGE update is unclear, but the Ethiopian government has engaged in further work to progress the long-term strategy (GGGI, 2022).\n",
    "The basis of Ethiopia’s mitigation policy is its Climate-Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy, published in 2011 (FDRE, 2011). As the name suggests, the strategy aims to keep greenhouse gas emissions low and build climate resilience, while achieving middle-income status by 2025. Ethiopia is currently reviewing progress and updating the CRGE strategy, which should take into consideration Ethiopia’s updated NDC.\n",
    "In June 2020, Ethiopia released its Ten Year Development Plan: A Pathway to Prosperity (2021-2030) (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). The new plan aims to bring economic growth, expecting 10.2% annual growth, while also supporting a climate-resilient green economy (Ethiopian Monitor, 2020b). The plan includes quantified targets to increase Ethiopia’s so-called greenhouse gas emissions reduction capacity from 92.7 MtCO2e to 162.3 MtCO2e by 2030. However, it is unclear if this is referring to emissions mitigation potential and if so, how it relates to the mitigation potentials presented in the updated NDC. The plan further includes similar emission reduction targets for agricultural subsectors and for transport and targets to increase electricity generation and access.\n",
    "Under current policy projections, GHG emissions in Ethiopia are expected to be 213–240 MtCO2e in 2030 (excluding land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF)). Emissions are higher than our last update. The increase is largely driven by an upward revision of historical emissions in 2016-2018 and the likely limited long-term impact of the pandemic. There is a high degree of uncertainty in these projections, given the limited data and policy information available for Ethiopia. We have also not attempted to estimate any impact the civil war may have on emissions.\n",
    "\n## Sectoral pledges\n",
    "In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.\n",
    "For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.\n",
    "NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.\n",
    "\n## Energy supply\n",
    "Ethiopia’s primary energy supply is dominated by biomass, as only about half of the population has access to electricity and less than 10% has access to clean cooking (IRENA, 2022b). Oil has the next largest share of the energy mix at 10%, followed by hydropower (3%) and coal (1%) used in the industry sector (IEA, 2021). Ethiopia relies on oil imports, with minimal domestic production.\n",
    "Ethiopia’s power grid is almost entirely decarbonised, with the majority of electricity generated by hydropower and a growing share of wind power.\n",
    "**Hydropower**\n",
    "For the period 2015 to 2020, Ethiopia aimed to increase power generating capacity from 4 GW in 2015 to 17 GW by 2020, with hydropower accounting for over 13 GW by 2020 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2016). According to available data, Ethiopia has not met these targets, with about 4 GW of installed hydropower generation capacity in 2021 (IRENA, 2022a).\n",
    "In the new 10-year plan, the government aims to increase export of electricity, which will require investments in an extensive distribution grid. Meeting this goal hinges on new hydropower projects, including the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) of 6 GW installed capacity and the Koysha dam of 2 GW installed capacity (Mpofu, 2021). In mid-June 2022, it was reported construction of the GERD was 88% complete and expected to be finished in 2023 (Ahmed Gomaa, 2022). The Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Agency (GCCIA) is also evaluating the feasibility of an electricity link with Ethiopia to import hydropower, in an attempt to reduce reliance on oil and gas for power generation (Darby, 2018).\n",
    "Hydropower projects, however, have faced delays, largely attributed to concerns over their sustainability, and their effect on downstream riparian states such as Egypt. There is significant disagreement between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (Al Jazeera, 2020). Reaching a permanent legal or institutional framework accepted by the affected states, which addresses the negative environmental effects, will be pivotal for Ethiopia to meet its targets. Such an agreement has not yet been reached, while Ethiopia began to fill the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile in June 2020 (Zane, 2020a, 2020b).\n",
    "**Other renewable generation**\n",
    "Ethiopia is participating in the Scaling-Up Renewable Energy Program (SREP) funded by the Climate Investment Funds (Climate Investment Funds, 2020). Under the SREP, the 200 MW geothermal Aluto Langano project and 120 MW Assela project, under construction, have received funding along with a clean energy small and medium enterprise facility (Construction Review Online, 2021; IEA, 2022b).\n",
    "Ethiopia is also part of the World Bank’s Scaling Solar program (World Bank, 2019). In April 2019, the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance initiated the second round of tenders for up to 750 MW. In the first round, two projects totalling 250 MW were both awarded to Saudi energy developer AWCA in September 2019. The projects are the first to be developed under Ethiopia’s new public-private partnership framework and are expected to avoid 0.32 MtCO2e per year (ACWA Power, 2019). However, many of these projects have also faced delays, with projects struggling to reach financial close (Ayele & Shen, 2022). While several challenges have been identified, one of the key challenges include foreign currency and convertibility barriers.\n",
    "\n## Agriculture\n",
    "Agriculture GHG emissions are responsible for about three-quarters of Ethiopia’s emissions (excl. LULUCF). Emissions from agriculture are expected increase more than any other sector under Ethiopia’s updated business as usual scenario (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). A 2020 progress assessment of the CRGE Strategy identified 39 ongoing or completed projects expected to have mitigation benefits in the agriculture/livestock sector (Pegasys, 2020).\n",
    "Livestock is the single largest source of emissions in Ethiopia (excl. LULUCF) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). Ethiopia has projects underway to reduce methane emissions from livestock including a project for the low emission development for the dairy sector with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.\n",
    "\n## Transport\n",
    "The latest available inventory data, from Ethiopia’s Second National Communication, indicates the transport sector accounted for 4% of national emissions in 2013; however, the updated NDC revised total energy emissions downward (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021; Ministry of Environment and Forest, 2015).\n",
    "The Ten Year Development Plan includes targets for the transport sector including increased rail infrastructure and utilisation and the reduction of transport emissions. However, the plan also aims to increase domestic and international flight passengers (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). In 2020, the government adopted a National Transport Policy which aims to increase rail and expand transport options that operate on renewable energy (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2020). The updated NDC aims to reduce transport emissions through transport electrification and public transport (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).\n",
    "**Electric Rail**\n",
    "Ethiopia’s updated NDC aims to electrify transportation, reducing demand for petroleum and increasing the share of electric vehicles. According to the CRGE strategy, the building of an electric railway network such as the 5,000 km electrified National Railway Network (NRN) has the greatest mitigation potential for the sector of the assessed interventions (FDRE, 2011). One segment of the NRN, the Ethiopia-Djibouti electric railway line, began commercial operations in January 2018 financed by the Export-Import Bank of China (Xinhua, 2018). As a landlocked country, the Ethiopia-Djibouti line is critical to shifting road transportation to rail as it connects Ethiopia to the Port of Doraleh. A second railway line, previously delayed due to a lack of finance, had been damaged in the civil war (Abiye, 2019; Ethiopia Observer, 2021). The Ten Year Development Plan aims to increase the length of railway from about 900 km to almost 4,200 km, but it does not specify how much of this would be electric (Planning and Development Commission, 2021).\n",
    "**Public Transportation**\n",
    "The updated NDC also aims to improve public transportation. Significant projects are underway in the capital, Addis Ababa, through the construction of a light rail transit (LRT) and a bus rapid transit (BRT). The LRT was completed in 2015 with support of the Export-Import Bank of China (Xinhua, 2019). The Ten Year Development Plan further aims to increase the capacity of the LRT from 75,000 to 200,000 passengers per day (Planning and Development Commission, 2021). The construction of the BRT started in 2020 with support from the French Development Agency (AFD), South Korea and the city itself (Ethiopian Monitor, 2020a; Fikade, 2018; Gebre, 2019). The BRT is not yet operational as of August 2022.\n",
    "Ethiopia anticipates meeting much of its updated NDC through reductions in emissions from the forestry sector (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).\n",
    "In May 2019, Ethiopia launched its National Green Development programme, led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, which included a plan to plant four billion trees in 2019 (Embassy of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia, 2020). As part of this effort, Ethiopia claims to have planted more than 350 million trees in a single day and to have reached the a total of four billion planted trees and seedlings by year’s end, though some have questioned the veracity of these figures provided by the government (BBC News, 2019, 2020; Mwai, 2019; National Green Development, 2020; Office of the Prime Minister, 2019). In 2020, the government aimed to plant another five billion trees that year and in 2021, the annual goal was six billion(Ethiopian Monitor, 2021; Getachew, 2020). Government reporting claims both goals were exceeded. The fourth round of tree-planting was launched in June 2022 with the goal of planting another six billion trees (Ethiopian Monitor, 2022).\n",

    "# Assumptions",
    "\n## Historical emissions\n",
    "Ethiopia provided revised historical data for 2010 in its NDC update using global warming potential values (GWPs) from the IPCC’s fifth assessment report (AR5) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). The government provides sector-level emissions data, but no information on the gas-by-gas breakdown. It also provided information on emissions data from livestock and managed soils, which we take to be the entirety of agriculture sector emissions.\n",
    "To complete the sector information for the industry and managed soils sectors, we used the sector-by-sector emission ratios for the NDC’s 2020 business as usual estimate. We use the gas-by-gas breakdown in PRIMAP for the year 2010 to estimate sectoral emissions by gas and then converted these from AR5 to AR4 values (Gütschow, J.; Günther, A.; Jeffery, L.; Gieseke, 2021).\n",
    "The NDC update covers the three main gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O). We added an estimate for HFCs using PRIMAP data for 2010 and scaling this estimate to our industry sector’s emissions total for 2010.\n",
    "We used PRIMAP growth rates for the energy, industry, agriculture, and waste to extend the historical time series for 1990-2019 based off of the 2010 estimate provided in the NDC update.\n",
    "To estimate emissions for 2020 and 2021, we applied a sectoral approach. For energy and industry, we applied growth rates from Global Carbon Budget for the year 2020 (Global Carbon Project, 2021), and the GDP growth rates from IMF for 2021, assuming a directly proportional development of CO2 emissions. For agriculture and waste, we assume a continuation of a 5-year trend. We assume that the impact of the pandemic on agriculture, waste and other emissions is minimal and so have extrapolated emissions for 2015–2019 up to 2021 using a 5-year average from historical emissions.\n",
    "\n## NDC and other targets\n",
    "2030 NDC target\n",
    "Ethiopia provides an estimate of each sector’s mitigation contribution to meeting its unconditional and conditional targets in its final NDC update submitted in July 2021 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). These estimates are given using AR5 GWP values. We exclude the contribution of LULUCF, which we assume to be CO2 only, and then convert all other sector from AR5 to AR4 using the gas-by-gas breakdown for 2010 historic data from PRIMAP (Gütschow, J.; Günther, A.; Jeffery, L.; Gieseke, 2021).\n",
    "The estimate provided in the final NDC update is for the main three gases only (CO2, CH4 and N2O). Our historical and current policy projections also include HFCs, however their contribution is very small and we have not taken it into account here.\n",
    "\n## Current policy projections\n",
    "We use a combination of data sources to estimate the lower bound of our current policy projection (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021; IEA, 2019; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).\n",
    "Lower bound projections\n",
    "Our energy-related CO2 emissions are based on growth rates from the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) for Ethiopia in the IEA’s Africa Energy Outlook 2019 (IEA, 2019). In general, neither the IEA Africa Energy Outlook 2019 report nor its annexes specify which of the policies have been included in the stated policies scenario. The IEA STEPS scenario was not updated in the IEA Africa Energy Outlook 2022 (IEA, 2022a).\n",
    "For the industry sector, we used the business as usual (BAU) projections from the updated NDC harmonised to our 2021 historical emissions estimate.\n",
    "For the agriculture and waste sectors, we used the US EPA’s non-CO2 emissions projection but applied these to sector totals as the contribution from CO2 in these sectors is negligible. For “other” emissions reported in PRIMAP (about 1% of emissions in 2019), we applied US EPA growth rates for N2O as these “other” emissions only included N2O.\n",
    "Upper bound projections\n",
    "The upper-bound of our current policy projection assumes that GHG emissions will grow according to the revised business as usual (BAU) scenario projections provided in the updated NDC of 2021 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). The base year for the BAU scenario is 2010. We have harmonised the series to the last historical year estimate (2021). This approach could potentially overestimate emission levels as we do not have sufficient information on the state of emissions reduction efforts or current policy implementation, both of which might downward revise the trajectory.\n",
    "\n## Global warming potentials\n",
    "The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Targets",
    "\n## Target Overview\n",
    "In July 2021, Ethiopia submitted its updated NDC, committing to a 68.8% reduction below a revised business-as-usual (BAU) scenario conditional on international support (incl. LULUCF) (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021). This target also includes an unconditional component, a 14% reduction below BAU, which Ethiopia will undertake with its own resources. Ethiopia intends to achieve both of these targets primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution and its conditional NDC target as “Critically Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways.\n",
    "Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral, but has not specified a target year (FDRE, 2015). The government is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy.\n",
    "\n## CAT rating of targets\n",
    "The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit would be, as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. Ethiopia will need international support to achieve the required reductions within its borders.\n",
    "Ethiopia’s NDC target includes a portion that is unconditional, that it will achieve using its own resources. We rate that portion against its fair share contribution. The full NDC target will require international support to achieve and we rate that against the level of reductions needed within Ethiopia’s border.\n",
    "Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found **here****.**\n",
    "Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways\n",
    "The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. Ethiopia should also propose a conditional NDC target that brings emissions down towards decarbonisation with external support. Its current conditional target is only compatible with more than 4°C of warming and should be strengthened. Ethiopia should ask for additional support to implement additional policies and meet its conditional NDC target.\n",
    "Ethiopia intends to achieve this target primarily through reductions in its land sector emissions. Yet, Ethiopia cannot ignore the growth in emissions in other sectors. It needs to strengthen its updated conditional NDC target further and will need additional international support to achieve this target.\n",
    "Since the last assessment, the CAT has updated its methodology and pathways included for deriving modelled domestic pathways. As a result of these changes, Ethiopia’s target rating now falls into the ‘Critically insufficient’ category rather than the ‘Highly insufficient’ category. The target itself is unchanged since our last update.\n",
    "Unconditional NDC target against fair share\n",
    "The CAT rates Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible”. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that Ethiopia’s unconditional NDC target reflects the fair share for a least developed country consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Ethiopia’s fair share target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.\n",
    "\n## NDC Updates\n",
    "Ethiopia submitted its final updated NDC in July 2021, building on an interim NDC update submitted in December 2020 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2021).\n",
    "Ethiopia commits to a 68.8% reduction below a revised business-as-usual (BAU) scenario conditional on international support (incl. LULUCF). This target includes an unconditional component, a 14% reduction below BAU, which Ethiopia will undertake with its own resources. This is an improvement from Ethiopia’s 2015 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), which did not include an unconditional component (FDRE, 2015).\n",
    "The 2021 updated NDC includes a revision of the BAU scenario used as a reference for the mitigation targets. While the revised BAU emissions level in 2030 is projected to be only slightly higher than in the 2015 INDC, it anticipates much higher emissions from LULUCF emissions in 2030. The updated, 2021 NDC further indicates the LULUCF sector would play a much larger role in achieving the targeted emissions reductions than in the 2015 INDC. Ethiopia intends to achieve its conditional and unconditional targets primarily (around 85% of total reductions) through reductions in its land sector emissions. Due to this increased reliance on the land sector to achieve its updated targets, we do not consider Ethiopia’s updated NDC an increase in ambition.\n",
    "The unconditional target results in an emissions level of 269 MtCO2e in 2030 (excl. LULUCF), while the conditional target would limit emissions to 237 MtCO2e (see Assumptions for details on how these figures were calculated).\n",
    "The CAT rates Ethiopia’s conditional target (“internationally supported target”) as “Critically Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways and its unconditional target (“fair share target”) as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution.\n",
    "* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.\n",
    "**Analysis of earlier NDC developments:**\n",
    "- **22.07.2021:** Ethiopia submits final updated NDC",
    "- **31.12.2020:** Ethiopia submits NDC update committing to first unconditional emissions target, though progression unclear",
    "\n## Net zero and other long-term target(s)\n",
    "Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral without specifying a target year (FDRE, 2015). Ethiopia is in the process of developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy with support from the Global Green Growth Institute, including developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. We evaluate the target as “Target information incomplete”.\n",

    "\n## 2020 pledge\n",
    "Under the Copenhagen Accord, Ethiopia proposed several Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) in the power, transport, forestry, agriculture and waste management sectors (FDRE, 2010). Limited information is available on the status of implementation of the NAMAs (UNFCCC, 2019).\n",
