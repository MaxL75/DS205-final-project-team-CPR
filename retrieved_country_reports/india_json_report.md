### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8433):**
> Our full net zero analysis is here. ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor**. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a net zero by 2070 target at COP26 in 2021 (Ministry of External Affairs, 2021).

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8486):**
> We calculate the emissions intensity in 2005 using our historical emissions estimate and RBI GDP data and then apply a 45% reduction. We multiply this emissions intensity level with our 2030 GDP estimate to derive our emissions estimate. As India has a separate target to enhance its carbon sink, we assume that LULUCF has been excluded from its emissions intensity target.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8397):**
> These documents and laws play a crucial role in shaping the energy landscape. There has been a steady increase in the deployment of renewable energy in the country, including both utility-scale and rooftop solar. Due to this consistent growth, the share of coal capacity has dropped below 50% for the first time.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8310):**
> India also states that developed countries should reach net zero emissions earlier than developing nations (before 2050) on the basis of global emissions equity and justice, and that they should provide financial and technical support for developing nations to accelerate their progress towards net zero. Yet, India does not provide any explanation or emissions pathway to demonstrate that its target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. ## Good practice  The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8328):**
> Financial and policy support has been extended for green hydrogen production and adoption in industry through the green hydrogen purchase mandate. India is planning to establish a domestic carbon market and has released draft rules for a compliance carbon market. The proposed system will include an emissions intensity target, similar to the previous cap-and-trade system known as Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT).
