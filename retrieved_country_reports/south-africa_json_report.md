## Country: South Africa

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8159):**
> The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government. ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**. South Africa states its intention to commit to a net zero CO2 target (“net zero carbon emissions”) by 2050 as part of a visionary statement in its LTS (Republic of South Africa, 2020).

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8085):**
> The Low-Emission Development Strategy highlights the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through various interventions but currently does not specify these in greater detail. - **Clarity on fairness of target** – South Africa provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness. ## Good practice  The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7862):**
> **  The energy crisis in South Africa has continued to worsen with 2023 reaching record-breaking load shedding, impacting the economy as well as the everyday lives of South Africans. Several of the measures passed by President Ramaphosa, such as the removal of the licencing threshold to unlock investment in distributed generation, have seen success. Government efforts to reform Eskom, South Africa’s public utility, are ongoing, with a new plan to provide debt relief for Eskom equivalent to over half of the company’s debt over the next three years to enable investment and maintenance of the power system.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8100):**
> The CAT will do so once further information is communicated by the government. ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**. South Africa states its intention to commit to a net zero CO2 target (“net zero carbon emissions”) by 2050 as part of a visionary statement in its LTS (Republic of South Africa, 2020).

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7757):**
> If all countries were to follow South Africa’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. Under current policies, South Africa will not reduce emissions enough to meet its NDC target range for 2030. Despite a range of measures announced in July 2022, the energy crisis has persisted in South Africa with load-shedding reaching record highs.
