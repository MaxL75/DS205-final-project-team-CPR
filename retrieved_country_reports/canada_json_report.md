### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8321):**
> Full details of the assessment are here. ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**. Canada passed the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021, which enshrines its 2050 net zero target into law.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8454):**
> - **Increase action to reduce domestic emissions**: Finally, what matters most is action to reduce emissions in the real economy. Our current policy projections for 2035 show a significant implementation gap with currently implemented policies and actions only reducing emissions by 23% below 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF).

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8207):**
> (‘Net zero energy ready’ means that the building is efficient enough that a renewable energy system, once added, would be able to provide all of the building’s energy needs). The aim is to move to progressively more stringent tiers so that by 2030 all new buildings are net zero energy ready. Provinces have agreed to implement this code by 2024 and subsequent updates with a year and a half from publication (Efficiency Canada & Carleton University, 2022).

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8303):**
> ## Good practice  The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets. ## 2035 NDC  ## 2035 Target Announcement  **This is a short assessment of the** **Canada’s 2035 headline target announcement.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8600):**
> Under the scheme, all Canadian provinces and territories must have a cap-and-trade system or carbon tax in place. Jurisdictions without such systems or taxes will fall under the federal backstop. The federal system has two components: a regulatory charge on fossil fuels and an output-based pricing system (OBPS), which applies to major emitting industrial facilities.
