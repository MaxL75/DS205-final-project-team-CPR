## Country: Bhutan

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7918):**
> - **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Bhutan does not provide information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target by 2050. While some of its sectoral LEDS quantify the mitigation potential based on the premise of avoided emissions due to renewable hydropower exports to India, it is unclear whether its economy-wide net zero target of 2050 relies on these avoided emissions (Royal Government of Bhutan 2020a). **Target architecture**  - **Legal status** – Bhutan's 2050 net zero is included in its second NDC submission (Royal Government of Bhutan 2021).

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8101):**
> LEDS of these four sectors provides detail of the measures and their mitigation potential under each timeframe, along with specific investment need up to 2050. Yet, certain sectoral measures evaluate mitigation potential by considering avoided emissions resulting from hydro power to India. It remains unclear the extent of dependency of Bhutan's net zero target on these avoided emissions.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8075):**

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7835):**
> - Advancing on its electric vehicle (EV) policies, as the government has started setting up EV charging stations and supporting a shift to EVs in the taxi industry. These actions build on other efforts taken in the transport sector last year to strengthen vehicle emission standards, though some initiatives, like the rapid mass transit system, have not advanced. - Expansion of its biogas production.
