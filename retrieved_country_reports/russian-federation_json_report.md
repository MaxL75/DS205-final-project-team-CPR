### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8147):**
> - **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Russia has not provided any information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target. **Target architecture**  - **Legal status** – Russia’s ‘Strategy of socio-economic development of the Russian Federation for low greenhouse gas emissions by 2050’, which contains its 2060 net zero target, was approved via government order, akin to legislation, in October 2021 (Russian Federation, 2021a). Russia submitted its Long-Term Strategy to the UNFCCC in September 2022 (Russian Federation, 2022c).

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8105):**
> - **Emissions coverage** – Although the long-term climate strategy does not explicitly list all greenhouse gases covered, the document mentions Russia aims to balance anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and sinks by "no later than 2060". Based on this, we interpret the strategy to cover all greenhouse gas emissions. The target covers all sectors of the economy (excluding international aviation and shipping).

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7850):**
> **  **In 2021, Russia adopted its law aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions, having gutted it of all measures that would have resulted in substantive emissions reductions. The Energy Strategy to 2035, adopted in 2021, focuses almost exclusively on promoting fossil fuel extraction, consumption, and exports to the rest of the world. Such a strong focus on increasing reliance on fossil fuel revenues poses a considerable economic risk in a future compatible with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C temperature limit.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8231):**
> ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate the target as: **Poor. **  Russia approved its ‘Strategy of socio-economic development of the Russian Federation with low greenhouse gas emissions by 2050’ in October 2021 and submitted it to the UNFCCC on September 5, 2022 as its long-term climate strategy (LTS) (Russian Federation, 2021a, 2022c). As part of this strategy, Russia has committed to reaching net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2060.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7838):**
> - **Emissions coverage** – Although the long-term climate strategy does not explicitly list all greenhouse gases covered, the document mentions Russia aims to balance anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and sinks by "no later than 2060". Based on this, we interpret the strategy to cover all greenhouse gas emissions. The target covers all sectors of the economy (excluding international aviation and shipping).
