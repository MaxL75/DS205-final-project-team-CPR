> The Climate Action Tracker continues to rate Iran’s provisional climate pledge and climate policy as “Critically insufficient”. **  In its 2015 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), Iran committed to reducing emissions by 4% (unconditional reduction) or 12% (conditional reduction) below business as usual (BAU) by 2030. Iran is expected to significantly overachieve both targets, with currently implemented policies.
