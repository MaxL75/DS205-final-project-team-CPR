## Country: Morocco

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8507):**
> ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate the net zero target as target: **information incomplete**. In its long-term strategy (LTS), Morocco speaks of its intention to achieve net zero within the century (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). The Moroccan government will further provide sectoral analysis to evaluate Morocco’s capacity to achieve carbon neutrality during the century.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8104):**
> Morocco’s target would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Morocco’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. We have revised our previous assessment to exclude the LULUCF mitigation measures planned in the agricultural sector.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7675):**
> In 2021, 82% of Morocco’s electricity mix was made up of non-renewable sources, a majority of which is derived coal (IRENA, 2022a). Our range of emissions under current policies does not include the expansion of fossil gas infrastructure which would shift emissions up, and Morocco could potentially lose the “1.5°C compatible” rating for its policies and actions. **The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8358):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets. ## 2035 NDC  ## 2035 NDC Target  Morocco has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7756):**
> However, in its LTS, the Moroccan government states that it is completing modelling to assess the country’s ability to reach carbon neutrality in the second half of the century. - **Emissions coverage** – Morocco refers to carbon neutrality in its LTS (Kingdom of Morocco, 2021c). For this reason, the CAT assumes Morocco’s target will only cover CO2 emission.
