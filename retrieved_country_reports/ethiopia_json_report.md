**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8508):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7990):**
> Land use and forestry are a significant source of Ethiopia’s emissions. Ethiopia intends to achieve the conditional and unconditional targets in its updated NDC primarily (around 85%) through reductions in its land sector emissions. Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral without specifying a target year (FDRE, 2015).

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7818):**
> This process will include developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. In 2020, Ethiopia joined the Climate Ambition Alliance: Net zero by 2050, but it is unclear what this means for Ethiopia’s net zero ambitions (Climate Ambition Alliance, 2019). For further information on the targets Ethiopia has adopted, see the targets tab.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8246):**
> This process will include developing business as usual and net zero emissions scenarios. In 2020, Ethiopia joined the Climate Ambition Alliance: Net zero by 2050, but it is unclear what this means for Ethiopia’s net zero ambitions (Climate Ambition Alliance, 2019).

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7731):**
> Land use and forestry are a significant source of Ethiopia’s emissions. Ethiopia intends to achieve the conditional and unconditional targets in its updated NDC primarily (around 85%) through reductions in its land sector emissions. Ethiopia intends to become carbon neutral without specifying a target year (FDRE, 2015).
