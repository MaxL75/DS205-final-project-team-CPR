### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8145):**
> We evaluate the net zero target as: “Average.” The German government needs to legislate its commitments to include international aviation and shipping emissions and undertake planning on how to reach the 2045 target to improve its rating to “Acceptable”. ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**. In June 2021, Germany adopted its 2045 net zero target in its revised climate law and submitted its updated LTS to the UNFCCC in November 2022.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8372):**
> - **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The climate law and LTS specify a separate emission removal target for forestry. Therein, Germany sets an emissions target of -25 MtCO2e by 2030, -35 MtCO2e by 2040 and -40 MtCO2e by 2045 for the LULUCF sector. The climate law does not specify if and how other carbon removals, such as direct air capture or biomass energy carbon capture and storage could be used to reach the net zero goal.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8380):**
> Before it changed the requirement, the ministry failed to submit emergency programmes for the three years in which the sector overshot its emissions target. - **Comply with own 65% renewables target in building sector**: the government had agreed in its coalition contract and thereafter on the ambitious goal that, as of 2024, all new heating systems would use 65% renewable energy. However, an intensive debate emerged, particularly around a ban on new fossil fuel heating systems.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8336):**
> The net zero target is enshrined in law by way of Germany’s Climate Protection Act. The German government is failing to provide explicit and transparent assumptions on some key elements with an update of the ‘Climate Action Plan 2050’ still under development as of June 2024. The proposed measures aim to achieve net zero on Germany’s own territory, but it remains unclear whether Germany reserves right to use of international offset credits.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8211):**
> For example, it could bring back the previously agreed upon “climate dividend,” where every citizen would receive a lump sum payment from the revenue generated through the carbon pricing mechanism. The government has postponed this measure to the next legislative period. ## Description of CAT ratings  The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which, in absence of a better method, are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.
