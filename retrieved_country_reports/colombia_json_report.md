## Country: Colombia

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8078):**
> ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate Colombia’s net zero target as: **Acceptable**. Colombia has a 2050 net zero GHG emissions target, which has been enshrined in domestic law (Ley de Accion Climatica N°2169/2021, 2021). In November 2021, Colombia submitted its long-term Climate Strategy E2050 to the UNFCCC.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8195):**
> While the overall NDC target remains the same, Colombia will focus more on reducing emissions outside of the land sector (LULUCF) than we had previously assumed, therefore leading to a more stringent target (when excluding LULUCF) under our methods. Colombia’s overall rating has changed from “Highly insufficient” to** **“Insufficient”. **  The CAT gives Colombia’s climate targets and policies an overall rating of “Insufficient”.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7915):**
> The latest long-term expansion plan from the National Energy Planning Unit rules out completely new coal-fired power plants due to low competitiveness against major growth of cheaper renewable sources. **  **The development of renewables and the global drive towards decarbonisation** **may risk leaving Colombia with stranded assets and lost economic opportunities if it does not initiate the transition away from fossil fuels. It is too soon to gauge whether the new President will be able to achieve this.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8042):**
> ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate Colombia’s net zero target as: **Acceptable**. Colombia has a 2050 net zero GHG emissions target, which has been enshrined in domestic law (Ley de Accion Climatica N°2169/2021, 2021). In November 2021, Colombia submitted its long-term Climate Strategy E2050 to the UNFCCC.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7856):**
> Even with planned measures, Colombia will need further action both to reach its current target and to be 1.5°C compatible. In December 2021, Colombia enacted the Climate Action Law, enshrining both its NDC and net zero targets into law. **  **To enhance climate action, Colombia should sign up to the coal exit.
