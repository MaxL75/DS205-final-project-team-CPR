### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8341):**
> **The full net zero target analysis can be found** **here****. **   ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate the net zero target as: **Acceptable**. Switzerland committed to a net zero target as part of its long-term strategy submitted to the UNFCCC in January 2021.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8322):**
> The target covers all sectors, including energy, agriculture, and waste, and includes all major greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4, and N2O. The emissions pathway outlined features clear intermediate sectoral targets and legislative measures aimed at meeting them. However, the sectoral targets fall short of the overall reduction goal, cumulatively leaving a gap of over 10 MtCO₂ and bringing domestic reductions to less than 50%.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8212):**
> The Act, however, is mainly a framework law, mandating the parliament to work out more concrete objectives and measures to meet the 2040 and 2050 sectoral targets. The Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply with Renewable Energies (see below) is set out to address this to some extent. Switzerland introduced a carbon levy charged on fossil fuels in 2008, which covers ~35% of CO2 emissions.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8256):**
> Further information on Switzerland’s net zero target can be found here. ## Fairness & Finance  Developed countries need to significantly scale up international climate finance and other means of support. Developed countries should set 1.5°C aligned domestic mitigation targets in their NDCs and communicate the financial and other support they will provide to developing countries.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7974):**
> The Act, however, is mainly a framework law, mandating the parliament to work out more concrete objectives and measures to meet the 2040 and 2050 sectoral targets.
