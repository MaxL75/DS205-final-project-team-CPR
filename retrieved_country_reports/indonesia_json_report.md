### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8468):**
> **   ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)  **We evaluate the net zero target as: Target information incomplete. **  Indonesia has not yet communicated an explicit net zero target but explores scenarios that could lead to net zero by 2060 or sooner in its long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC in July 2021 (Government of Indonesia, 2021). The government has made steps in integrating its long-term target into core sectoral planning documents.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8576):**
> For agriculture, waste, and other sectors, we apply a five-year trend. The two alternatives create a minimum and maximum current policies projections for energy non-CO2 and non-energy emissions. We subsequently harmonise these projections to historical data.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8493):**
> These laws are supplemented by various implementing regulations from the central government, the President, ministries, and local governments. The National Energy Policy (KEN), outlined in Government Regulation No. 79 of 2014, sets targets for the minimum share of new and renewable energy (23%), coal (30%), and gas (22%) in the energy mix by 2025.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8346):**
> **   ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)  **We evaluate the net zero target as: Target information incomplete. **  Indonesia has not yet communicated an explicit net zero target but explores scenarios that could lead to net zero by 2060 or sooner in its long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC in July 2021 (Government of Indonesia, 2021). The government has made steps in integrating its long-term target into core sectoral planning documents.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8501):**
> International efforts to price embedded carbon, such as the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), will significantly reduce the competitiveness of carbon-intense goods, like coal-derived fuels. Carbon pricing  Indonesia launched the first Emissions Trading System (ETS) in Southeast Asia in February 2023, and the government expects to transform it into a hybrid ‘cap-tax-and-trade’ system by 2025. - The first operational phase (2023-2024) covers on-grid coal plants of 100 MW or larger.
