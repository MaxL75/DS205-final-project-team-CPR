### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8374):**
> This represents an accelerated target from its original ‘carbon neutrality’ target for 2065 submitted to the UNFCCC in October 2021 (Thailand Government, 2021). We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average. ** For details on the analysis, see the Net zero tab.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8430):**
> ## Industry  The industrial sector’s non-energy emissions represented approximately 10% of Thailand’s GHG emissions in 2021 (approx. 37 MtCO2), , excluding LULUCF (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2022). Under the Climate Change Master Plan (2015–2050), Thailand has a goal to reduce GHG emissions by 7–20% below 2005 levels in the energy and transport sectors by 2020, a target subjected to international support (Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 2015).

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8352):**
> The government has since taken measures to bring down emissions from the buildings sector, both in the residential and commercial and public buildings. Under the Energy Efficiency Development Plan (EEDP) (2015), the government identifies the need for buildings and appliances to be more energy efficient. It sets an energy consumption reduction target of 4,819 ktoe by 2036 in the commercial and public buildings sector, with an additional reduction of 2,153 ktoe in the residential sector (APERC, 2017).

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8427):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets. ## 2035 NDC  ## 2035 NDC Target  Thailand has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8059):**
> Our current and planned policy projections do not include this Plan’s targets, as the strategic documents that inform the Plan have since been outdated (e.g. PDP2010). Thailand is implementing a domestic carbon reduction scheme, the Thailand Voluntary Emission Reduction Scheme (T-VER), and is into the third phase of its Voluntary Emissions Trading Scheme (V-ETS), both launched in 2013.
