### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8175):**
> The net zero target is further included in the EU’s LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in 2020 (Croatian Presidency and the European Commission, 2020) - **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The EU does not provide separate emission reduction and removal targets as part of its net zero target. However, in its latest proposal for 2040 targets to achieve net zero emission by 2050, it highlighted separate information on emission and removal pathways but this is yet to be adopted as a target (European Commission, 2024b). - **Review process** – The EU has a legally binding process in place to review the net zero target itself.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8438):**
> This represents 3–9% ambition gap. For more details on our projections, see the Assumptions tab. To be 1.5°C compatible, current policies would need to reach at least 1,815 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) by 2030.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8123):**
> The 2040 ban leaves the member state to decide whether or not they wish to include this in their national phase-out plans (Verplancke et al., 2024). The implementation timeline of the revised EPBD is too slow. Key milestones, such as mandatory solar installations for new public and commercial buildings by 2027 and minimum energy performance standards for existing buildings by 2033, push essential changes far into the future.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8423):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets. ## 2035 NDC  ## 2035 NDC Target  The EU has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8041):**
> - **Review process** – The EU has a legally binding process in place to review the net zero target itself. The EU Climate Law includes a legally binding process for the Commission to report on the operation of the regulation within six months of each Global Stocktake (Article 9a). When it does so, the Commission may include proposals for amendments to the regulation.
