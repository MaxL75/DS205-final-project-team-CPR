### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8505):**
> ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  Mexico does not have a net zero target. The targets presented in the 2022 NDC update are solely focused on 2030. There is no indication about an update to the Mid-Century Strategy from 2016, a net-zero target or any other long-term target.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8408):**
> For years 2020 and 2021, we estimate emissions based on a sectoral approach. For the energy and industry sectors we assume a correlation between emissions and GDP, and thus apply economic growth forecasts from the IMF (IMF, 2022). For agriculture and waste sectors, we extend the last five years of pre-COVID historic trend.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8148):**
> Due to the lack of details on the contribution of the forestry and land use sector in the updated climate targets, we consider a range between assumptions. See the Assumptions section for more details. 1Mexico includes electricity generation through fossil gas efficient cogeneration of as part of its definition of ‘clean energies’.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8337):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets. ## 2035 NDC  ## 2035 NDC Target  Mexico has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8061):**
> Given the reforms and restructuring of Mexico’s climate policies and institutions, it remains to be seen how and if the targets of the new PECC will be implemented. In 2014, Mexico implemented a carbon tax that was set at approximately at US$3.5/tCO2e differentiated by fuel type (SEMARNAT, 2014). This tax generated about US$263 million in 2019.
