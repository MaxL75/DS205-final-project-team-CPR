## Country: The Gambia

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8508):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8159):**
> Though the target covers all gases, it does not cover all sectors. The LTS covers energy (consisting of the sub-sectors electricity and transport), agriculture, waste, and LULUCF, which represents 81% of The Gambia’s total emissions (Gütschow et al., 2021; Republic of The Gambia, 2020). 95% of GHG emissions is the threshold for a better evaluation according to the CAT methodology.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7782):**
> **  **Increasing its renewable energy generation and transitioning to an affordable sustainable, renewable energy system would put The Gambia fully onto a 1.5°C-compatible pathway, avoid carbon intensive technology lock-in, and improve its energy security, while also achieving a critical milestone for the country’s socio-economic development. **  **The Gambia’s land sector, accounting for one third of emissions, has turned from a net sink to a source, and, if deforestation continues at the same rate, the government warns there will be no forests left by 2050. ** **It has implemented policies to begin turning the situation around.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8109):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7585):**
> **  **The total absolute emissions level in 2030 is higher in the updated NDC than in the first. As a result, the CAT’s rating of its conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways and the overall rating have fallen from "1.5°C compatible" to "Almost sufficient". The country will need international support and more stringent policies to meet its NDC targets.
