## Country: Chile

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8062):**
> ** Chile’s currently proposed net zero target for 2050 covers most key elements and is now also Legally Binding through the Framework Law. Chile’s target covers all sectors and gases, communicates strategic goals and emissions targets per sector, and provides a detailed methodological framework. Notably, Chile underpins these sector-specific ambitions with detailed emissions pathway analyses.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8161):**
> LULUCF) by 2030 (6–13% below 2021 levels, when emissions peaked). This emissions level is also insufficient to reach both the conditional and unconditional 2030 NDC targets (88–95 MtCO2e). Chile needs to implement additional policies in order to be 1.5° compatible.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7974):**
> This is in line with the Ministry of Energy’s Decarbonisation Plan target to retire or reconvert 70% of coal-fired units by the end of 2025, representing 3.6 GW in capacity. Gas must still be phased out in the short-term, however, and Chile should be careful when repurposing plants to avoid carbon lock-in and stranded assets. Recent scientific literature highlights that there is no room for investment in new oil, gas, and coal activities if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8133):**
> ** Chile’s currently proposed net zero target for 2050 covers most key elements and is now also Legally Binding through the Framework Law. Chile’s target covers all sectors and gases, communicates strategic goals and emissions targets per sector, and provides a detailed methodological framework. Notably, Chile underpins these sector-specific ambitions with detailed emissions pathway analyses.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8015):**
> - **Decrease economic incentives for fossil fuels. ** Chile’s carbon tax is considered relatively ineffective due to its low carbon price, while diesel fuel is still subsidised for internal combustion engines (ICE). - **Implement concrete mitigation measures in the energy end-use, industry, agriculture, and waste sectors** so that they can also contribute to emissions reductions leading up to 2030.
