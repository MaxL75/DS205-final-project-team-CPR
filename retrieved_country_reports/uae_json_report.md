### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8368):**
> In March 2023, the UAE’s member states signed the UAE Governments Net Zero 2050 Charter, further signalling commitment to reaching net zero (WAM, 2023). We evaluate the net zero target as ‘Average’. For the full analysis click here.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8453):**
> This scenario includes a sectoral breakdown and detailed information at the measure level. This is a significant improvement compared to our previous current policy scenarios which were based only on the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050. Second, the UAE’s 5th National Communication to the UNFCCC also includes updated inventory data, which is 15% lower than our previous estimates, mainly due to differences in industrial process emissions and fugitive emissions.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8164):**
> 48–87). The government commits to economy-wide absolute net emissions targets for 2040 (86 MtCO2e) and 2045 (51 MtCO2e). For the energy sector, the UAE plans on deploying large-scale renewables, nuclear energy, and fossil gas as key pillars to achieving net zero by 2050.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8350):**
> ## Good practice  The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets. ## 2035 NDC  ## 2035 NDC Target Overview  Although the UAE submitted an ambitious 2035 mitigation target (which lands below our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathway for 2035), we do not label UAE's overall NDC commitment as 1.5°C compatible.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7843):**
> ## Summary  ## Overview  **Since our last update, the UAE has made significant progress both in terms of plans and in transparency, publishing an updated national emissions inventory and a comprehensive policy plan. This allowed for a more detailed assessment of the country's climate action, which has contributed to an improved rating. However, it also has become clear that the UAE is planning to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to achieve its 2050 net zero target, undermining the target's credibility.
