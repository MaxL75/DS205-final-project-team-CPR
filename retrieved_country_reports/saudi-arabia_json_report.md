### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8182):**
> **   ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)  We evaluate the target as: Poor. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced Saudi Arabia’s net zero target for 2060 at the first Saudi Green Initiative Forum in October 2021 (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2021d). However, the target has yet to be enshrined in law, or in a policy document.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7975):**
> - **Significantly increase the pace of renewable energy deployment,** which would help drive decarbonisation efforts and stimulate sustainable job growth for its young population, all of which are objectives of the Vision 2030 agenda. - **Update its NDC by strengthening its 2030 target**, providing an absolute emissions reduction target (instead of a reduction below an uncommunicated baseline scenario) and clarifying the assumptions on LULUCF. - **Clarify the assumptions behind its 2060 net zero target**, which currently lacks transparency and credibility, and does not provide a clear emissions reduction pathway.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8013):**
> Saudi Arabia is taking steps to improve energy efficiency in buildings. Through the national Energy Services Company, TARSHID, the government aims to renovate numerous government buildings, public schools, hospitals, and mosques throughout the country (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2021b). Efforts are also underway to develop and implement an Energy Use Intensity (EUI) ecosystem (Saudi Arabia, 2024).

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8175):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets. ## 2035 NDC  ## 2035 NDC Target  Saudi Arabia has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8108):**
> Information on how the Kingdom intends to use its carbon crediting scheme remains unclear or lacks details, and presents major risks that it will seek to use carbon credits with questionable integrity as a smokescreen to justify continuing its trajectory of maintaining high levels of domestic emissions. For more information on the role of voluntary carbon markets under the Paris Agreement and their associated risks, see Fearnehough et al. 2020.
