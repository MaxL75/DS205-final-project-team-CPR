### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8072):**
> ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  The Philippines does not have a net zero target. For further information on the targets the Philippines has adopted, see the Targets tab. ## Good practice  The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8146):**
> Government data shows nearly zero emissions from the sector in 1994, but a net sink (removal of CO2 from the atmosphere) of 105 MtCO2/yr in 2000 and a sink of 37 MtCO2e by 2010. Recent government data shows a shrinking net sink, with estimates of -21.6 MtCO2/yr in the LULUCF sector for 2021. This sector is at risk of becoming a source of emissions with commodity-driven deforestation as the dominant driver of tree cover loss.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8100):**
> - Consideration of a 50% EV stock target by 2040 as part of its Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) currently under development. The Philippines was the first country in the Southeast Asian region to set a moratorium on new coal, and is implementing several measures to support renewables. However, these actions will not halt emissions growth.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?
