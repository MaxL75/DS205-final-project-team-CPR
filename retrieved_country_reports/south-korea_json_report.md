## Country: South Korea

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8412):**
> The net zero target does not include overseas reductions. However, it lacks clarity on emissions coverage and detail in the government’s review process. ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8309):**
> - **Separate reduction & removal targets** – South Korea’s draft 2050 net zero pathways plan for a LULUCF sink of 25.3 MtCO2e in 2050. The document lists strengthening forest circulation management and expanding afforestation and reforestation but does not reference any specific plans. Earlier in 2021, the Korea Forest Service announced a reforestation plan that could lead to a removal of 34 million tonnes CO2 (Republic of Korea, 2021d).

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7969):**
> **  **South Korea’s climate change mitigation and energy sector planning still lacks the necessary speed and stringency it needs to get onto a pathway compatible with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. **  **The January 2023 10****th**** Basic Electricity Plan passed in January 2023 proposes revising the targets for the country's electricity mix by 2030 and 2036, aiming for more nuclear than previous targets, at the cost of renewable energy, while its targeted share of coal and LNG are similar. While this change has a limited effect on 2030 emission levels, the deprioritisation of renewable energy hampers a transition towards a 1.5°C pathway.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8185):**
> The net zero target does not include overseas reductions. However, it lacks clarity on emissions coverage and detail in the government’s review process. ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8143):**
> Activists also comment that the estimate of 34 million tonnes CO2 removal is highly inflated (KFEM, 2021). - **Review process** – In its LTS, South Korea states that it will regularly review and update its carbon neutral strategy (Republic of Korea, 2020). The Carbon Neutrality Act states that sectoral strategies will be reviewed every five years and that the implementation of the strategy and targets will be assessed.
