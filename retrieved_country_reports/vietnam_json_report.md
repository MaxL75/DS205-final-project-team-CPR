### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8508):**
> Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8442):**
> - **Comprehensive planning** – In its National Climate Change Strategy, Viet Nam provides detailed sectoral emissions reductions targets for energy, industrial process, agriculture and waste, as well as the LULUCF sector along with sector specific key action areas. This strategy also provides an interim target in 2030 of 36% reduction from BAU level of emissions (excluding LULUCF) in 2030 (977 MtCO2e) and emissions peaking by 2035. The strategy states that Viet Nam will not develop new coal-fired power plants after 2030, and it will gradually reduce its coal fleet after 2035.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8204):**
> The plan proposes a share of renewable generation of 31-39% by 2030, and 47% in case of a “full and substantial” implementation of the JETP by international partners. The Master Plan for National Energy sets an energy-related greenhouse gas emissions target of 399-449 MtCO2e by 2030, compared to 259 MtCO2e in 2021. **The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here** **.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8185):**
> Viet Nam announced a target to achieve net zero by 2050 during the COP26 World Leaders’ Summit in 2021. In July 2022, Viet Nam reiterated its commitment to reach net zero in the decision approving its National Climate Change Strategy, aimed at guiding its planning to achieve net zero by 2050. Viet Nam’s net zero target is conditional on international financial support.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7890):**
> The emissions cap is divided between the energy (101 MtCO2e), industry (20 MtCO2e), agriculture (56 MtCO2e), and waste (8 MtCO2e) sectors. The strategy aims at compensating for the remaining emissions with removals from the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector and an increase in carbon sequestration in the agriculture sector. The National Climate Change Strategy calls for a gradual transition from coal-fired electricity to cleaner energy sources, reducing the share of fossil fuel energy sources, not developing new coal-fired power projects after 2030, while gradually reducing coal power capacity after 2035.
