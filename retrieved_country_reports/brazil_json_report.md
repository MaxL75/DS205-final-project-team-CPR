## Country: Brazil

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8600):**
> **  The full net zero target analysis can be found here. ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate Brail’s net zero target as: **Poor. **  Brazil aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a target reiterated in its 2023 NDC submission (Government of Brazil, 2023b).

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8435):**
> To be 1.5°C compatible, Brazil would need to reduce at least 85% of their total emissions (incl. LULUCF) by 2035, compared to 2005 levels (368 MtCO2e). - The target of 59% below 2005 amounts to 1,033 MtCO2e in 2035, incl.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7949):**
> ## Credibility  Credible NDCs should build on robust national planning processes that translate the economy-wide emissions reduction target into action in all sectors. Governments need to ramp up the implementation of their existing targets and further develop policies to close the – still significant – emissions gap between current policies and 1.5°C. Contradictory policies must be addressed and reversed: fossil fuel production needs to be phased out, while fossil fuel exploration and fossil fuel subsidies need to stop.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8521):**
> **  The full net zero target analysis can be found here. ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate Brail’s net zero target as: **Poor. **  Brazil aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a target reiterated in its 2023 NDC submission (Government of Brazil, 2023b).

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7902):**
> According to the latest national inventory data for 2005, this is consistent with an emissions level between 832–1,033 MtCO2e in 2035 (in AR4 GWPs, incl. LULUCF). Brazil has communicated its intent to use the Paris Agreement's Article 6, with carbon offset transfers being authorised to sell its emission reductions from 67% up to the level of 59% below 2005 levels by 2035.
