### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8353):**
> Country makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target   ## Ten key elements  - **Target year** – The US government is committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest (U.S. Department of State, 2021). - **Emissions coverage** – The US net zero target includes all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (U.S. Department of State, 2021). - **International aviation and shipping** – The US government deliberately excludes international aviation and shipping from its net zero target’s coverage (U.S. Department of State, 2021).

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8568):**
> **See full summary of** **policies and actions here****. **  We rate the US domestic target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 44%–49% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Almost sufficient” when **compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8262):**
> Energy efficiency standards for consumer products and appliances in the US are generally ambitious; a 2023 review of the stringency of minimum energy performance standards determined that the federal government’s energy standards for electric motors, refrigerators, and water heaters meet or exceed international best practice (Mavandad & Malinowski, 2023). The EPA’s voluntary energy efficiency labelling programme, ENERGY STAR, supports the government’s efficiency standards. The programme labels efficient products, as well as residential, commercial, and industrial buildings and, in 2020, is estimated to have reduced emissions by 400 MtCO2e, which is equivalent to a 5% reduction in total national emissions (ENERGY STAR, 2023).

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8444):**
> The 2035 NDC does not include a renewable energy capacity target. Instead, the document references the US power sector target of generating 100% “clean,” “carbon pollution-free" electricity by 2035. This target is not—and should not be—conflated with a renewable energy target.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8068):**
> The US implemented a diverse patchwork of financial incentives to support the research and development of technologies that are key for industrial decarbonisation. However, the government has not introduced instruments to facilitate the commercialisation of many of the technologies needed in hard-to-abate industrial subsectors (System Change Lab, 2024). Unlike the EU, the US has not developed a national emissions trading scheme, which, if designed correctly, could help expediate the commercialisation of key technologies.
