### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8033):**
> ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We rate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**  The Peruvian Government updated its NDC at the end of 2020, stating its intention to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Peru is in the process of updating its Climate Change National Strategy with a timeframe up to 2050. In January 2022, the government declared a climate emergency of national interest through its Supreme Decree N°003-2022-MINAM and indicated that the new Climate Change strategy will be approved latest by October 2022 (Ministry of Environment of Peru, 2022a).

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8352):**
> The land use, land-use change and forestry sector has consistently been a significant source of emissions in Peru over the last 20 years. For those years where data is available, emissions from LULUCF are higher or at a similar level as those from all other sectors together. Peru’s updated NDC makes reference to a goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8066):**
> We estimate that emissions under current policies will reach 116 MtCO2e, excl. LULUCF, by 2030 (116% above 1990 levels). In the energy sector, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation and total primary energy supply continues to increase, despite further investments in fossil fuels.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7959):**
> The CAT evaluates this target as: “Target information incomplete”, given its preliminary nature and a lack of more detailed information. The assessment will be done once further information is communicated by the government. ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We rate the net zero target as: **Target information incomplete**  The Peruvian Government updated its NDC at the end of 2020, stating its intention to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7681):**
> We estimate that emissions under current policies will reach 116 MtCO2e, excl. LULUCF, by 2030 (116% above 1990 levels). In the energy sector, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation and total primary energy supply continues to increase, despite further investments in fossil fuels.
