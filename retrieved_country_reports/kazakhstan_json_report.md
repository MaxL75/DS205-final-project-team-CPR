### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8170):**
> ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**  Kazakhstan announced a net zero by 2060 target at the Climate Ambition Summit in December 2020 and, in September 2021, the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources published the Doctrine (strategy) for achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 for public discussion akin to a green paper (Republic of Kazakhstan, 2021). On 2 February 2023, the President of Kazakhstan approved the resultant Strategy for achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, thereby enshrining the net zero target in law. The net zero target covers all economic sectors and all GHG emissions.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8393):**
> ## Current policy projections  Current policy projections stem from the “with measures” scenario from the Fifth Biennial Report. We harmonise this scenario to historical emissions reported in the latest country inventory using growth rates. The “with measures” scenario includes measures and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that have been taken or are planned to be adopted in the near future.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8356):**
> In the power sector, shares of renewable energy – excluding old hydro-power plants – reached 4.5% in 2023, on track with the government's modest targets. Similarly, energy efficiency policies have contributed to a declining trend in the economy's emissions intensity. However, the balance between policies that support emissions growth and those supporting mitigation remains skewed to the former.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8024):**
> Government retained an economy-wide emission reduction target for 2030 of 25% relative to the 1990 base year. We rate the unconditional NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Kazakhstan’s unconditional NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8227):**
> Kazakhstan could consider carbon pricing to cover all sectors, enhancing stringency through increasing the carbon price while lowering the emissions cap, and improving the credibility of the system through more predictable planning and more robust MRV. In its fifth Biennial Report to the UNFCCC (2022), government mentions a carbon tax for sectors not covered by the ETS in its scenario “With Additional Measures” scenario. However, the indicative price level used is rather low: starting at USD 2 per ton of CO2-eq and increasing at USD 2 increments up to 2030 (to USD 16) and at USD 2.5 up to 2035 (to USD 29).
